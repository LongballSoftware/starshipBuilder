# Starship Creation and Combat for 5e

## Starship Creation

To build a ship, select a hull and add components to it. Each ship is required to have a bridge, crew quarters, thrusters, life support, shields, and a core. In addition, there are a variety of supplemental components and weapons that can be added to the ship.

The maximum mass of all components on a ship is determined by its hull type and the power limit of a ship is determined by its core. The ship point maximum for any given ship is set by the GM in accordance with its role in the campaign, with the average player-operated ship assumed to be a frigate worth around 50 SP.

## Starship Hulls

| Hull Class | Max Mass | HP | AC | Speed | Hardpoints | Crew (Min/Max) | SP |
|------------|----------|----|----|-------|------------|----------------|-----|
| Fighter* | 15 | 10 | 12+Dex | 10 | Forward | 1/2 | 20 |
| Frigate | 40 | 30 | 12 | 5 | Forward, Port, Starboard | 4/12 | 40 |
| Cruiser | 60 | 50 | 15 | 3 | Forward, Port(2x), Starboard(2x), Aft | 25/100 | 60 |
| Dreadnought | 100 | 100 | 18 | 3 | Forward(2x), Port(2x), Starboard(2x), Aft | 100/1000 | 70 |

*Fighters are light attack craft designed to support larger vessels and do not require their own crew quarters, shield, or core. Instead of a core, they have 20 power by default and maintain this charge for 24 hours before they must dock in larger ship.*

## Ship Combat Rules

### Turn Structure

Each round, a ship must take 1 Movement Action and may take 1 Attack Action. Characters who do not participate in the movement or attack actions may take an Additional Action.

### Movement Actions

The standard movement action is for a ship to move forward a number of spaces equal to its Speed. If the pilot wishes to take an alternate Movement action, they may choose from the list below:

- **Accelerate**: The pilot announces whether they are attempting to speed up or slow down before rolling a DEX check against a DC of 12. If they succeed, they may increase or decrease the number of spaces moved that turn by half the ship's Speed. On a failure they move the normal amount. On a critical failure, the ship does the opposite of what the pilot intended (speeding up if they attempt to slow down and vice versa)

- **Turn**: The pilot makes a DEX check against a DC of 12. If they succeed, they may turn the ship up to 90 degrees in either direction during their movement. The ship must move at least half of its speed before turning. On a failure, the ship does not turn. On a critical failure, the ship turns the opposite direction the pilot intended to.

- **Accelerate and Turn**: The pilot announces whether they are attempting to speed up or slow down before rolling a DEX check against a DC of 15. If they succeed they may increase or decrease the number of spaces moved that turn by half the ship's Speed. They may then turn the ship up to 90 degrees in either direction during their movement. The ship must move at least half of its new total movement speed before turning. On a failure, the ship continues moving forward at its normal movement speed. On a critical failure, the ship does the opposite acceleration, turns the wrong way, or both, at the GM's discretion.

- **Evasive Maneuvers**: The pilot begins evasive patterns, flying in unpredictable arcs to avoid enemy fire. This ship adds +2 to its AC until the start of its next turn. The ship moves as if it had taken the standard movement action.

### Attack Actions

Attack actions allow a ship's weapons to be used:

- **Fire One Weapon**: The character firing the weapon rolls an attack against the enemy ship.

- **Fire Multiple Weapons**: The character leading the salvo can roll a single attack against the enemy ship or multiple characters can roll attacks, one for each weapon fired. If all the attacks are rolled as single roll, they cannot score a critical hit

- **Reload**: If a weapon requires restocking and the ship has a cargo bay or armory with ammo stores in it, a character may use the ship's attack action to reload the weapon to full capacity.

### Additional Actions

Characters who did not take part in either the Movement or Attack actions during a round can make an Additional Action. Additional Actions can be taken at any point during a ship's turn.

- **Hail Another Ship**: Use the ship's comms array to send a message or open a call with another ship involved in the combat.

- **Emergency Repairs**: Roll TECH check vs DC 12 to fix damage. On success, restore 1d4 + INT bonus HP. If attempting to repair a damaged component, roll 1d6 - INT bonus to determine how many rounds the component will take to return to operation (min 1).

- **Use a Component**: Use a supplemental ship component to aid in some way.
